# Task 2: `gapminder` country comparison


```{r}
glimpse(gapminder)

head(gapminder, 20) # look at the first 20 rows of the dataframe

```


```{r}
country_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(country == "Italy") # just choosing Italy, as this is where I come from

continent_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(continent == "Europe")
```


```{r, lifeExp_one_country}
plot1 <- ggplot(data = country_data, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)+
  NULL 

```


```{r, lifeExp_one_country_with_label}
plot1 <- plot1 +
  labs(title = "Life Expectancy in Italy from 1952 to 2007",
      x = "Year",
      y = "Life Expectancy") +
  NULL


plot1
```


```{r lifeExp_one_continent}
 ggplot(data = continent_data, mapping = aes(x =  year, y = lifeExp  , colour = country, group = country))+
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  NULL +
  ggtitle("Life Expectancy in Europe from 1952 to 2007")
```


```{r lifeExp_facet_by_continent}
ggplot(data = gapminder , mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, colour= country))+

```


With only minor exemptions (e.g. bump in Europe in the 80s, probably Baltic states), it is visible that life expectancy in the Americas, Europe and Oceania has increased fairly steadily. This data supports the common believe, that advancements in medicine and hygiene, stable nutrition supply, less wars and overall enhancements in quality of life have contributed to an increase in life expectancy.\

In Asia and Africa, however, there is once again an overall trend to increasing life expectancy but fluctuations and exemptions are more common. Especially in some African countries we see a sharp decline in life expectancy starting from the 80s and 90s. It can be speculated that this is due to epidemics - especially HIV â€“ but also due to civil wars or famines. The average life expectancy in Asia and Africa reached in 2007 is well below that of Europe and Oceania. The standard deviation is also higher, which leads to the conclusion that there are major difference among single countries.


# Task 3: Brexit vote analysis


```{r load_brexit_data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# read data directly off github repo
brexit_results <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kostis-christodoulou/am01/master/data/brexit_results.csv")


glimpse(brexit_results)
```


```{r brexit_histogram, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# histogram
ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = leave_share)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2.5) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of leave % during Brexit Vote",
       subtitle = "All constituencies",
       x = "leave %-share",
       y = "# constituencies")

# density plot-- think smoothed histogram
ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = leave_share)) +
  geom_density() + 
  labs(title = "Density plot of leave % during Brexit Vote",
       subtitle = "All constituencies",
       x = "leave %-share",
       y = "Constituencies density")


# The empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) 
ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = leave_share)) +
  stat_ecdf(geom = "step", pad = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  labs(title = "Cumulative Distribution of leave % during Brexit Vote",
       subtitle = "All constituencies",
       x = "leave %-share",
       y = "Cumulated share of constituencies")
  
```

```{r brexit_immigration_correlation}
brexit_results %>% 
  select(leave_share, born_in_uk) %>% 
  cor()
```

The correlation is almost 0.5, which shows that the two variables are
positively correlated.


```{r brexit_immigration_plot}
ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = born_in_uk, y = leave_share)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.3) +
  
  # add a smoothing line, and use method="lm" to get the best straight-line
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  
  # use a white background and frame the plot with a black box
  theme_bw() +
  
  # Add titles
  labs(title = "Relationship between native borne residents and leave share",
       subtitle = "All constituencies",
       x = "native borne uk residents %-share",
       y = "leave %-share") +
  NULL
```


The graph shows a correlation (0.5) between the % of native born residents within a constituency and its leave %-share. A large bulk of constituencies has a born_in_uk rate of 90% and above whereby the average of leave %-share among this majority-group seems to lie around 55%. In constituencies where the % of native born residents is below 80% on the other hand, the average submitted votes would have kept the UK within the EU. These findings support the statement that patriotic, UK born citizens are more likely to oppose the EU and its regulations (among which looser immigration policies). \

However, a significant standard deviation can be observed across all %-shares of native borne uk residents. In other words, this means that two constituencies with a similiar 80% "native share" have voted in favor of Brexit with 70% as well as 20%. Thus, it is suggested not to regard native born % and fear of immigration as only explanation for the Brexit outcome.

# Task 4: Animal rescue incidents attended by the London Fire Brigade

```{r, instances_by_calendar_year}

  arrange(desc(percent))


animal_rescue %>% 
  
  #count does the same thing as group_by and summarise
  # name = "count" will call the column with the counts "count" ( exciting, I know)
  # and 'sort=TRUE' will sort them from max to min

  # filter resulting data, so each group has at least 6 observations
  filter(n()>6) %>% 
  
  # summarise() will collapse all values into 3 values: the mean, median, and count  
  # we use na.rm=TRUE to make sure we remove any NAs, or cases where we do not have the incident cos
  summarise(mean_incident_cost = mean (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            median_incident_cost = median (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            sd_incident_cost = sd (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            min_incident_cost = min (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            max_incident_cost = max (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            count = n()) %>% 
  
  # sort the resulting data in descending order. You choose whether to sort by count or mean cost.
  arrange(desc(mean_incident_cost))

```



Median usually lower, this lets us conclude that we have outliers on the top end of the cost range (single animals very difficult to rescue). 



```{r, plots_on_incident_cost_by_animal_group,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# base_plot
base_plot <- animal_rescue %>% 
  group_by(animal_group_parent) %>% 
  filter(n()>6) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=incident_notional_cost))+
  facet_wrap(~animal_group_parent, scales = "free")+
  theme_bw()

base_plot + geom_histogram()
base_plot + geom_density()
base_plot + geom_boxplot()
base_plot + stat_ecdf(geom = "step", pad = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)



```


Variability is best shown in the boxplot graph as single outliers get lost in the other graphs due to the significant number of observations.\ 
As expected, large animals such as horses, cows, and deer are on average the most expensive to rescue. It is speculated that it takes more working-hours and machinery to recover heavier animals. While the minimal cost is similiar across the categories, the maximum cost seams to have some positive correlation with animal size.\ 
Correspondingly, the sd is significant in these categories, with the maximum value as high as 10x the median rescue cost. Animals such as Rabbits and Ferrets have the least outliers, a fact that could lead to the conclusion that the rescue effort for these animals is fairly predictable.
